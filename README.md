You can always count on me when it comes to my family, when someone needs help, when it comes to lending a hand.

In a group I position myself as a person who moves the group forward, I like to put people at ease


### my getaway

I was in a campsite in the south of France, there was an evening organized. I was so far away because I was drunk I ended up sleeping in someone else's tent that I didn't know.
